I'm an assistant professor at Princeton University, in the [Lewis-Sigler Institute for Integrative Genomics](https://lsi.princeton.edu/people/michael-skinnider) and the [Ludwig Princeton Branch](https://ludwigcancer.princeton.edu/people/michael-skinnider).

Previously, I completed a combined [MD/PhD](http://mdprogram.med.ubc.ca/mdphd/) at the University of British Columbia. My research, with [Leonard Foster](https://www.msl.ubc.ca/people/dr-leonard-foster/), focused on developing new computational methods to interpret mass spectrometry-based proteomic and metabolomic datasets. I also spent time at EPFL, applying single-cell and spatial transcriptomics to study spinal cord injury with [Gregoire Courtine](https://www.neurorestore.swiss/). 

Before that, I earned a [Bachelors of Arts & Science](https://artsci.mcmaster.ca) from McMaster University. My undergraduate research, with [Nathan Magarvey](https://chemistry.mcmaster.ca/component/comprofiler/userprofile/magarv.html), focused on computational methods for natural product discovery. Some of these methods are now being licensed by [Adapsyn Bioscience](https://www.adapsyn.com/).

When I'm not in the lab, I'm probably hanging out with my [wife](https://partnerships.princeton.edu/people/jessie-skinnider) and our [dog](https://www.instagram.com/cooghyies/).
